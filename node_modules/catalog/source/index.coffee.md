## Catalog
A OODB like something for javascript (nodejs)
This is for myself to test if literate cofeescript is good for real use :)

#### Includes
The first includes are the one that should also be in package.sjon

    Q = require 'kew'
    mysql = require 'mysql'
This is so I can check if there is a handler given to the ´Catalog´ constructor :)

    Connection = require('mysql/lib/Connection')
And here come the requires of the internal classes

    Table = require './lib/table'
#### Main Catalog class
This one is the one that is require'd.
Use ´new Catalog(handler, ['users', 'posts', 'comments'])´ for example when you need a blog database.

    class Catalog
      constructor: (infoOrHandler, tables=[]) ->
        if infoOrHandler instanceof Connection # Check if it is an handler:
          @connection = infoOrHandler ## If so, store it
        else
          @connection = mysql.createConnection(info) ## If not, make a new connection

        tables.forEach (table) => ## Make all tables accessable using just the property (eg. catalog.tablename instead of catalog.getTable(tablename))
          Object.defineProperty this, table,
            enumerable: no
            get: @getTable.bind this, tables

This function is to get a table
      getTable: (table) ->
        new Table(this, table)
